# Ultrasonic Ball Tracker (Arduino + Python + Pygame)

A simple ball tracking system using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** connected to an **Arduino Uno**.  
The Arduino measures distances and sends them via **Serial** to a Python program, which displays the ball’s movement in real-time using **Pygame**.

## Features
- Reads distance from **one ultrasonic sensor**.
- Sends live measurements to Python via Serial.
- Displays a moving dot in Pygame based on sensor readings.
- Adjustable box and scaling parameters.
